            <h2>'a little bit about me'</h2>
            <p>In addition, I am also actively participating in the Independent Campus Program organized by the Ministry of Education and Culture (Kemendikbud). I joined the MSIB Independent Study Program with Infinite Learning Indonesia. I took the field of Web Development. This program gave me the opportunity to gain additional experience outside the classroom, such as unique learning, research, and projects related to web creation, from web design or coding. This was a valuable opportunity for me to develop my skills and knowledge outside of campus.</p>
